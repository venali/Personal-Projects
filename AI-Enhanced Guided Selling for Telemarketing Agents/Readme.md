Hereâ€™s a Python Program to help you get started with your AI-Enhanced Guided Selling:

Program Breakdown:
1.	GPT-3 Integration:
	o	The function get_product_recommendations uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate personalized recommendations based on customer input. You can customize this by including more detailed preferences like features, brands, etc.
2.	NLP for Intent Detection:
	o	The function process_user_query uses basic NLP techniques to detect whether the customer is asking for a recommendation, making a purchase inquiry, or asking a general question. You can enhance this with libraries like spaCy or transformers for more advanced intent detection.
3.	Backend Integration:
	o	The function store_user_preferences simulates storing customer preferences using an API call. You can use your backend services to store and retrieve user data to personalize recommendations.
4.	Deploying on Google Cloud:
	o	The deploy_model_to_gcp function showcases how to deploy your model to Google Cloud Functions for scalable real-time use.
5.	Recommendation Flow:
	o	The recommendation_flow function demonstrates a full cycle of querying, analyzing, and recommending products to the user.
This progran is a starting point. You can extend it with more advanced NLP techniques, personalized recommendation algorithms, and an enhanced backend system for storing user data.
